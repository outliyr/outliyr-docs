# Tips for Effective Blockout

### Best Practices for Using the Compound Blockout System

The `Compound Blockout System` is designed for speed and flexibility in the early stages of level design. By following these tips, you can maximize its effectiveness in your `Gameplay Maps`.

### General Workflow Tips

* **Start Broad, Then Refine:**
  * Begin by defining the largest, most significant volumes of your map using simple `Box` or `Room` shapes. Establish the overall footprint and major player paths.
  * Gradually add more detail with smaller shapes and boolean operations. Don't try to build everything perfectly from the start; iterate quickly.
* **Embrace Non-Destructive Editing:**
  * The primary advantage of this system is its parameter-driven nature. Feel free to experiment with dimensions, angles, and operations.
  * If a part of your blockout isn't working, you can easily tweak parameters, reorder shapes, or delete elements without having to rebuild geometry from scratch.
* **Utilize Boolean Operations (`Add` vs. `Subtract`):**
  * `Add` is your primary tool for building up geometry (e.g., walls, platforms, stairs).
  * `Subtract` is invaluable for creating negative spaces like doorways, windows, or custom cutouts. For instance, to make a window, add a `Box` for your wall, then add another `Box` with `Subtract` operation, positioning it where the window should be.
  * Remember that the **order** of shapes in the "Shapes" array of your `Compound Blockout Actor` is critical for boolean operations. Shapes are processed from top to bottom.
* **Think in Volumes:**
  * Instead of thinking about individual surfaces, conceptualize your level in terms of solid and empty volumes. This mindset naturally aligns with how the boolean operations work.
* **Use Distinct Material Overrides:**
  * Assigning different, simple colored materials to various `Add` shapes (e.g., red for hazards, green for playable space, blue for water) can greatly aid in visualizing gameplay flow, sightlines, and cover opportunities during blockout.
  * Leave `MaterialOverride` empty to use the `Compound Blockout Actor`'s default material for a unified look.

### Optimizing for Blockout

* **Keep Resolutions Reasonable:**
  * For shapes like `Sphere`, `Cylinder`, or `Ramp`, avoid excessively high `Steps` counts. While the system is optimized, very dense meshes are unnecessary for blockout and can impact editor performance if you have many complex actors.
  * Aim for "just enough" detail to convey the shape and test gameplay.
* **Understand UVs:**
  * The UVs generated by `Compound Blockout Shapes` (e.g., via box projection for the `Ramp`) are designed for basic texture tiling with your blockout materials.
  * Do not expect these UVs to be production-ready for final art assets. For final, highly detailed environments, dedicated UV unwrapping in a Digital Content Creation (DCC) tool (like Blender or Maya) will be necessary for texture artists.

### Avoiding Material/Face Artifacts

Because shapes are merged together using boolean operations, **coplanar faces** or very close parallel faces between two shapes can result in:

* Z-fighting (flickering faces).
* Material overrides bleeding onto the wrong shape.
* Unexpected surface reconstruction during boolean merges.

To minimize this:

* Avoid placing two shapes so that a face from one exactly aligns with a face from another â€” offset by at least a small amount.
* For decorative separation, leave a visible gap rather than touching faces edge-to-edge.
* If you need perfectly aligned seams, plan to clean up and repaint in a DCC tool (Blender, Maya, etc.) after export.

This is normal behavior for mesh booleans in Unreal and most 3D tools, final art passes can fully resolve these issues if needed.

### Transitioning to Final Art

* **Exporting for DCC:** When your blockout is complete and approved, you can export the generated `UDynamicMeshComponent` from the `Compound Blockout Actor` as a static mesh. This provides a precise blueprint for your environment artists to work from in their DCC tool.
* **Replacing Blockout:** Once final art assets are ready, you can gradually replace the `Compound Blockout Actors` in your `Gameplay Maps` with production-ready static meshes, maintaining the layout and scale established during blockout.

By leveraging the `Compound Blockout System` effectively, you can accelerate your level design process, iterate on gameplay spaces with unmatched flexibility, and build a strong foundation for your final `Gameplay Maps`.
