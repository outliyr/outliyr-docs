# Attachment System

One of the most powerful and flexible features of this inventory system is the **Attachment System**. It allows items to be designated as capable of **hosting** other items (attachments) in specific slots, and for other items to **be** attachments. This enables complex item customization, such as adding scopes, grips, and magazines to weapons, or socketing gems into armor, all handled through a unified, fragment-based approach.

### Purpose: Modular Item Customization

The core goal is to allow:

* **Defining Attachment Slots:** Specify arbitrary slots on a "host" item using Gameplay Tags (e.g., `Lyra.Attachment.Slot.Scope`, `Lyra.Attachment.Slot.Underbarrel`).
* **Defining Compatibility:** Control which specific attachment items can go into which slots on a particular host item.
* **Define Dynamic Behavior:** Dictate what happens when an attachment is successfully added to a host. This includes:
  * Spawning and attaching visual **Actors** (e.g., a scope mesh appearing on a rifle).
  * Granting **Gameplay Abilities** (e.g., an underbarrel grenade launcher granting a "Fire Grenade" ability).
  * Adding **Input Mappings** or **Input Configs** (e.g., a laser sight adding a keybind to toggle it).
  * Modifying host item **Stats** (e.g., a stock changing recoil, typically via abilities affecting Tag Attributes on the host's Equipment Instance or Stat Tags on its Item Instance).
* **Nested Attachments:** Allow attachments themselves to act as hosts for further attachments, enabling deep and complex customization chains (e.g., a scope with its own rail for a micro red-dot sight).
* **Runtime Modification:** Players can add and remove attachments dynamically during gameplay.

### Core Concepts & Components

The system revolves around the interplay between a static fragment on the definition and a runtime fragment on the instance:

1. **`UInventoryFragment_Attachment` (Static Fragment):**
   * Added to an `ULyraInventoryItemDefinition`. Its presence on an item definition solely makes that item a **HOST** capable of accepting other attachments.
   * **Configuration Hub:** This is where you define:
     * `CompatibleAttachments`: A map specifying the slots the host offers (`FGameplayTag`) and, for each slot, which attachment item definitions (`TSubclassOf<ULyraInventoryItemDefinition>`) are allowed, along with their specific `FAttachmentDetails` (behavior upon attachment).
     * `DefaultAttachments`: A map allowing the host item to spawn with certain attachments pre-installed.
2. **`UTransientRuntimeFragment_Attachment` (Runtime Fragment - UObject):**
   * Automatically created for any `ULyraInventoryItemInstance` whose definition includes the static `UInventoryFragment_Attachment`.
   * **Live Management:** Stores the `AttachmentArray` (a replicated list of currently attached `FAppliedAttachmentEntry` items).
   * **State-Driven Behavior:** Monitors the host item's state (Held/Holstered) and activates/deactivates the visual, ability, and input effects of attached items based on their configured `FAttachmentDetails`.
   * **Handles Nesting & Replication:** Manages the complexities of nested attachments and ensures the state of attached items (including their own runtime fragments) is replicated.
3. **`FAttachmentAbilityData_SourceAttachment` (Source Data Struct):**
   * A specialized locator struct (derived from `FAbilityData_SourceItem`) used by GAS to safely and uniquely identify an item within an attachment slot, even if deeply nested.
4. **`ULyraGameplayAbility_FromAttachment` (Ability Base Class):**
   * The recommended base class for Gameplay Abilities that are _granted by an attachment_. It provides convenient helper functions to access the attachment itself, its parent (host) item, and the root equipment context.
5. **Utility Abilities (e.g., `GA_EquipmentAttributeModifier`, `GA_MagazineStatModifier`):**
   * Pre-built Gameplay Abilities (subclassed from `ULyraGameplayAbility_FromAttachment`) designed to simplify common attachment tasks like modifying host equipment stats (Tag Attributes) or host item stats (Stat Tags like magazine capacity). These are configured and added to `AbilitySetsToGrant` within the `FAttachmentDetails`.

### Attachment Examples

<details>

<summary>Simple Visual Attachment (Scope)</summary>

**Goal:** Attach a scope mesh to a rifle. The scope itself grants no new abilities but provides a visual change.

1. **Define Items & Fragments:**
   * **Host Item (`ID_Rifle_Marksman`):**
     * Has `UInventoryFragment_EquippableItem` (linked to `ED_Rifle_Marksman`).
     * Has `UInventoryFragment_Attachment` with the following in `CompatibleAttachments`:
       * Key: `Lyra.Attachment.Slot.Optic`
       * Value (`FAttachmentSlotDetails`):
         * `AttachmentDetailsMap`:
           * Key: `ID_Attachment_Scope_4x`
           * Value (`FAttachmentDetails`):
             * `AttachmentIcon`: `T_UI_Icon_OpticSlot`
             * `HolsteredAttachmentSettings`:
               * `ActorSpawnInfo`: `ActorToSpawn = BP_Scope_4x_HolsteredVariant`, `AttachSocket = rifle_optic_socket`, `AttachTransform = (Adjusted for holstered view)`
             * `HeldAttachmentSettings`:
               * `ActorSpawnInfo`: `ActorToSpawn = BP_Scope_4x_Attached`, `AttachSocket = rifle_optic_socket`, `AttachTransform = (Identity or fine-tuned for held view)`
   * **Attachment Item (`ID_Attachment_Scope_4x`):**
     * Has `UInventoryFragment_InventoryIcon` (for UI).
     * Has `UInventoryFragment_PickupItem` (to be droppable, specifying `SM_Scope_4x_Pickup` mesh).
     * _(Does NOT need `UInventoryFragment_Attachment` unless it can host further attachments)._
   * **Actor Blueprints:**
     * `BP_Scope_4x_Attached`: Contains the scope mesh intended for when the rifle is held.
     * `BP_Scope_4x_HolsteredVariant`: (Optional) A different mesh or LOD for when the rifle (and scope) are holstered.
2. **Runtime Behavior (Simplified):**
   * Player has `ID_Rifle_Marksman` equipped (instance: `RifleInstance`).
   * Player adds `ID_Attachment_Scope_4x` (instance: `ScopeInstance`) to the `Lyra.Attachment.Slot.Optic` on `RifleInstance` (e.g., via UI drag-drop triggering server-side `AddAttachmentToItemInstance`).
   * The `UTransientRuntimeFragment_Attachment` on `RifleInstance`:
     * Adds an `FAppliedAttachmentEntry` for `ScopeInstance` to its `AttachmentArray`.
     * If `RifleInstance` is currently **Held** (via `bIsEquipped` on its runtime fragment):
       * It reads `HeldAttachmentSettings` from the entry.
       * It calls `SpawnAttachmentActor`, which spawns `BP_Scope_4x_Attached` and attaches it to `RifleInstance`'s held weapon actor at `rifle_optic_socket`.
     * If `RifleInstance` is currently **Holstered** (via `bIsHolstered`):
       * It reads `HolsteredAttachmentSettings` and spawns/attaches `BP_Scope_4x_HolsteredVariant`.
   * When `RifleInstance` transitions between Held and Holstered (e.g., player swaps weapons), the `OnEquipped`/`OnHolster` callbacks on its `UTransientRuntimeFragment_Attachment` trigger deactivation of the old state's actor and activation of the new state's actor for the scope.

**Result:** The scope mesh appears correctly on the rifle, changing its visual based on whether the rifle is held or holstered.

<summary>Attachment Granting a Gameplay Ability (Laser Sight Toggle)</summary>

**Goal:** Attach a laser sight that grants the player an ability to toggle the laser on/off when the host weapon is held.

1. **Define Items & Fragments:**
   * **Host Item (`ID_Pistol_Tactical`):**
     * Has `UInventoryFragment_EquippableItem`.
     * Has `UInventoryFragment_Attachment` with `CompatibleAttachments`:
       * Key: `Lyra.Attachment.Slot.AccessoryRail`
       * Value (`FAttachmentSlotDetails`):
         * `AttachmentDetailsMap`:
           * Key: `ID_Attachment_LaserModule`
           * Value (`FAttachmentDetails`):
             * `HeldAttachmentSettings`:
               * `AbilitySetsToGrant`: `[{AS_LaserToggleAbility}]` (An Ability Set containing `GA_ToggleLaserSight`)
               * `ActorSpawnInfo`: `ActorToSpawn = BP_LaserModule_Attached` (Mesh with a controllable laser beam component)
               * `InputConfig`: (Optional) `InputConfig_LaserToggle` mapping an input action (e.g., `IA_ToggleAccessory`) to `Ability.Weapon.ToggleLaser`.
             * `HolsteredAttachmentSettings`: (Laser actor might be hidden or off, no abilities/input).
   * **Attachment Item (`ID_Attachment_LaserModule`):** Standard Icon/Pickup fragments.
   * **Ability Set (`AS_LaserToggleAbility`):** Contains `GA_ToggleLaserSight`.
   * **Gameplay Ability (`GA_ToggleLaserSight`):**
     * Inherits from `ULyraGameplayAbility_FromAttachment`.
     * In `ActivateAbility`:
       * Uses `GetAssociatedAttachmentItem()` to get the laser module instance.
       * Uses `GetSpawnAttachmentActor()` to get the `BP_LaserModule_Attached` actor instance.
       * Calls a function/event on `BP_LaserModule_Attached` to toggle its laser beam visibility/effect.
       * When ability is removed, turn off the laser beam
   * **Actor Blueprint (`BP_LaserModule_Attached`):** Contains the laser mesh and a `UParticleSystemComponent` or `UNiagaraComponent` for the laser beam, with functions to toggle its visibility.
2. **Runtime Behavior (Simplified):**
   * Player attaches `ID_Attachment_LaserModule` to `ID_Pistol_Tactical`'s accessory rail.
   * Pistol is **Held**:
     * The `UTransientRuntimeFragment_Attachment` on the pistol instance:
       * Spawns `BP_LaserModule_Attached`.
       * Grants `AS_LaserToggleAbility` to the player's ASC (Source Object will be the pistol instance, Dynamic Source Tag will be `Lyra.Attachment.Slot.AccessoryRail`).
       * (If configured) Adds `InputConfig_LaserToggle` to the player's input.
   * Player presses the input mapped in `InputConfig_LaserToggle` (e.g., 'L' key).
   * `GA_ToggleLaserSight` activates. It finds its spawned laser actor and toggles the beam.
   * Pistol is **Holstered**:
     * Abilities and Input Config from the laser module are removed. The `BP_LaserModule_Attached` might be destroyed and replaced by a holstered variant or simply hidden/disabled by its logic.

**Result:** Player gains a new ability (and potentially input) to control the laser sight only when the pistol with the laser attached is actively held.

<summary>Nested Attachments &#x26; Stat Modification (Magazine with Baseplate)</summary>

**Goal:** A rifle magazine (`ID_Attachment_Magazine_30Rnd`) attaches to a rifle. This magazine _itself_ can host a "Magazine Baseplate" attachment (`ID_Attachment_MagBase_Tactical`). The baseplate slightly improves the _rifle's_ reload speed (a Tag Attribute on the rifle's `ULyraEquipmentInstance`), and the magazine itself defines the _rifle's_ magazine capacity (a Stat Tag on the rifle's `ULyraInventoryItemInstance`).

1. **Define Items & Fragments:**
   * **Host Item (`ID_Rifle_Carbine`):**
     * Has `UInventoryFragment_EquippableItem` (links to `ED_Rifle_Carbine`).
       * `ED_Rifle_Carbine`'s `Instance Type` is `ULyraWeaponInstance` (or a subclass). This instance will have the `Weapon.Stat.ReloadSpeedMultiplier` Tag Attribute.
     * Has `UInventoryFragment_SetStats` that _might_ initialize `Weapon.Ammo.MagazineCapacity` to a default (e.g., if no magazine is attached).
     * Has `UInventoryFragment_Attachment` with `CompatibleAttachments`:
       * Key: `Lyra.Attachment.Slot.MagazineWell`
       * Value (`FAttachmentSlotDetails`):
         * `AttachmentDetailsMap`:
           * Key: `ID_Attachment_Magazine_30Rnd`
           * Value (`FAttachmentDetails` for the 30Rnd Magazine):
             * `HeldAttachmentSettings`:
               * `ActorSpawnInfo`: Spawns `BP_Magazine_30Rnd_Attached`.
               * `AbilitySetsToGrant`: `[{AS_Magazine_30Rnd_Effects}]`
             * `HolsteredAttachmentSettings`: (Likely just ActorSpawnInfo).
   * **First-Level Attachment (`ID_Attachment_Magazine_30Rnd`):**
     * Standard Icon/Pickup fragments.
     * **Crucially, also has `UInventoryFragment_Attachment`** with `CompatibleAttachments`:
       * Key: `Lyra.Attachment.Slot.MagazineBaseplate`
       * Value (`FAttachmentSlotDetails`):
         * `AttachmentDetailsMap`:
           * Key: `ID_Attachment_MagBase_Tactical`
           * Value (`FAttachmentDetails` for the Tactical Baseplate _when attached to this magazine_):
             * `HeldAttachmentSettings`:
               * `ActorSpawnInfo`: Spawns `BP_MagBase_Tactical_Attached`.
               * `AbilitySetsToGrant`: `[{AS_MagBaseplate_Tactical_Effects}]`
             * `HolsteredAttachmentSettings`: (Likely just ActorSpawnInfo).
   * **Second-Level Attachment (`ID_Attachment_MagBase_Tactical`):** Standard Icon/Pickup fragments.
2. **Define Abilities & Effects:**
   * **Ability Set (`AS_Magazine_30Rnd_Effects`):**
     * Contains an instance of your **`GA_MagazineStatModifier`** subclass (e.g., `GA_Magazine_Set30RndCapacity`).
       * `GA_Magazine_Set30RndCapacity` Defaults: Configured to set the `Weapon.Ammo.MagazineCapacity` **Stat Tag** on the _host equipment's item instance_ to `30`.
   * **Ability Set (`AS_MagBaseplate_Tactical_Effects`):**
     * Contains an instance of your **`GA_EquipmentAttributeModifier`** subclass (e.g., `GA_MagBaseplate_ReloadBonus`).
       * `GA_MagBaseplate_ReloadBonus` Defaults: Its `FloatStatModification` array is configured with:
         * `Tag`: `Weapon.Stat.ReloadSpeedMultiplier`
         * `ModificationValue`: `0.95` (example for 5% faster)
         * `ModOp`: `Multiply`
3. **Runtime Behavior (Simplified):**
   * Player has `ID_Rifle_Carbine` (`RifleInstance`) equipped and **Held**.
   * **Step A: Magazine Attached**
     * Player attaches `ID_Attachment_Magazine_30Rnd` (`MagInstance`) to `RifleInstance`'s `MagazineWell` slot.
     * The `UTransientRuntimeFragment_Attachment` on `RifleInstance` activates `MagInstance`'s behaviors because the rifle is Held.
     * `AS_Magazine_30Rnd_Effects` is granted.
     * `GA_Magazine_Set30RndCapacity` (subclass of your `GA_MagazineStatModifier`) activates:
       * It uses `GetAssociatedEquipmentItem()` to get `RifleInstance`.
       * It calls `RifleInstance->SetStatTagStack(TAG_Weapon_Ammo_MagazineCapacity, 30)`.
       * (It also handles potential ammo overflow/underflow logic if the capacity changes while ammo is present).
     * The rifle now effectively has a 30-round magazine capacity.
   * **Step B: Baseplate Attached to Magazine**
     * Player attaches `ID_Attachment_MagBase_Tactical` (`BaseplateInstance`) to `MagInstance`'s `MagazineBaseplate` slot.
     * Since `MagInstance` is active (because `RifleInstance` is Held), `MagInstance`'s `UTransientRuntimeFragment_Attachment` activates `BaseplateInstance`'s behaviors.
     * `AS_MagBaseplate_Tactical_Effects` is granted. The `SourceObject` for this grant is `MagInstance`.
     * `GA_MagBaseplate_ReloadBonus` (subclass of your `GA_EquipmentAttributeModifier`) activates:
       * It uses `GetAssociatedEquipmentInstance()` to correctly find the `ULyraEquipmentInstance` of the root `RifleInstance`.
       * It iterates its preconfigured `FloatStatModification` array.
       * It calls `RifleEquipmentInstance->ModifyTagAttribute(Weapon.Stat.ReloadSpeedMultiplier, 0.95, EFloatModOp::Multiply)` and stores the returned `FFloatStatModification` handle internally.
     * The rifle's `ReloadSpeedMultiplier` Tag Attribute is now modified.
   * **Step C: Baseplate Removed**
     * Player removes `BaseplateInstance` from `MagInstance`.
     * `GA_MagBaseplate_ReloadBonus` is removed from the ASC.
     * Its `EndAbility` (or similar cleanup) logic iterates its stored `FFloatStatModification` handles and calls `RifleEquipmentInstance->ReverseTagAttributeModification()` for each, restoring the rifle's reload speed.
   * **Step D: Magazine Removed**
     * Player removes `MagInstance` from `RifleInstance`.
     * `GA_Magazine_Set30RndCapacity` is removed.
     * Its `EndAbility` logic would revert the `Weapon.Ammo.MagazineCapacity` Stat Tag on `RifleInstance` (perhaps to a default value, or another magazine's value if one is swapped in).
     * Since `BaseplateInstance` was attached to `MagInstance`, its effects are also implicitly deactivated and cleaned up because its parent attachment (`MagInstance`) is no longer active in the context of the rifle.

**Result:**

* The rifle's magazine capacity (a Stat Tag on its Item Instance) is directly controlled by the attached magazine's specialized `GA_MagazineStatModifier`.
* An attachment _on the magazine_ (the baseplate) can correctly modify stats (Tag Attributes) on the _root weapon's Equipment Instance_ using the specialized `GA_EquipmentAttributeModifier` and its helper `GetAssociatedEquipmentInstance()`.
* Changes are properly reversed when attachments are removed due to the abilities storing modification handles or performing cleanup in their `RemoveAbility`.

These examples demonstrate the versatility of the attachment system: purely visual changes, adding new abilities/inputs, and even creating nested structures that can influence the host item's core stats. The key is careful configuration of the `CompatibleAttachments` map and the `FAttachmentDetails` within the host item's `UInventoryFragment_Attachment`.

### Structure of this Section

Due to its depth, the Attachment System documentation is broken into the following detailed sub-pages:

* **Concepts & Setup:** How to configure `UInventoryFragment_Attachment` (`CompatibleAttachments`, `DefaultAttachments`), define slots with tags, and set up `FAttachmentDetails` behavior.
* **Runtime (`UTransientRuntimeFragment_Attachment`):** Details on how the runtime fragment manages the `AttachmentArray`, applies behaviors based on host state (Held/Holstered), handles nesting, and replicates state.
* **GAS & API:** How to interact with attachments via Gameplay Abilities (`ULyraGameplayAbility_FromAttachment`), the `FAttachmentAbilityData_SourceAttachment` locator struct, the `UAttachmentFunctionLibrary` helpers, and relevant Gameplay Messages.
* &#x20;**Provided Attachment Utility Abilities:** A guide to the pre-built abilities like `GA_EquipmentAttributeModifier` and `GA_MagazineStatModifier`, explaining their purpose, configuration, and how to use them to easily implement common attachment effects.

***

This overview introduces the Attachment System as a powerful, fragment-driven feature for modular item customization. It highlights the key components involved – the static definition fragment, the dynamic runtime fragment, and supporting GAS elements – setting the stage for a deeper look into its configuration and runtime behavior.
