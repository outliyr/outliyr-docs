# Consume Fragment

### “What makes this item usable?”

When you drag a brand-new **Item Definition** into your project it is just data: e.g. name, icon, etc\
One of the ways of letting a player _do_ something with it while it's in inventory is attaching exactly one extra fragment:

```
ID_EnergyDrink
└─ Fragments
   ├─ InventoryFragment_Icon
   ├─ InventoryFragment_SetStats
   └─ **InventoryFragment_Consume**   ← you add this
```

The **Consume Fragment** is the switch that turns a plain object into a “use-item”:

* **points** to the Ability that performs the effect;
* **tells** the system how many units to deduct when consumed;
* **chooses** whether the player is locked in place, briefly paused, or free to spam other items.

#### Adding the fragment step-by-step

1. **Open** the item definition asset (e.g. `ID_HealthPotion`).
2. In the _Fragments_ array press **`+`** ➜ choose **InventoryFragment\_Consume**.
3. Fill the properties (see next section).
4. Press **Compile** then **Save**.
5. That’s it. The UI “Use” button in the Tetris Inventory already knows what to do.

### What happens at runtime

1. Player presses **Use**, through some UI, and sends a gameplay event to run a `GA_Consume` ability.
2. **GA\_Consume** looks for _InventoryFragment\_Consume_ on the target item.
3. It spawns the _Ability To Activate_ picked in the fragment.
4. The chosen **Finish Policy** tells GA\_Consume when to end:
   * immediately,
   * after `ConsumeItem()` fires, or
   * after the ability fully ends.
5. Inside your effect ability you call **`ConsumeItem()`** exactly when the cost should be paid.
6. `OnConsumeItem` is called in the ability, which should be populated per consume ability.

No other system needs to know the details; the fragment carries everything.

<summary>Example Medkit (channelled heal)</summary>

| Setting             | Value                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Ability To Activate | `GA_Consume_MedkitHeal`      |
| Amount To Consume   | 1                            |
| Finish Policy       | **Block Until Ability Ends** |

`GA_Consume_MedkitHeal` plays a 3-second montage, then calls `ConsumeItem()`, then `EndAbility()`.\
During those 3 s the player cannot start another consume.

<summary>Energy Drink (instant stamina buff)</summary>

| Setting             | Value                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Ability To Activate | `GA_Consume_EnergyDrink` |
| Amount To Consume   | 1                        |
| Finish Policy       | **End Immediately**      |

The effect ability applies a buff and calls `ConsumeItem()` in the same tick.\
The player can slam multiple drinks in rapid succession.

| Pressing **Use** does nothing       | Fragment missing or `Ability To Activate` unset                                         | Add fragment / pick ability class                                                  |
| Item never leaves inventory         | Effect ability forgot to call  `ConsumeItem()` or forgot to override `OnConsumeItem()`  | Call `ConsumeItem()` where you want stack deducted, and populate `OnConsumeItem()` |
| Player stuck, can’t use other items | Finish Policy set to _Block Until Ability Ends_ but ability never ends                  | Ensure ability calls `EndAbility()` (after montage, delay, etc.)                   |

The `UInventoryFragment_Consume` serves as the simple, static data link for consumable items. It points the generic "use" action towards the correct specific effect ability and defines the default cost associated with a successful use, enabling a data-driven approach to defining item consumption.
