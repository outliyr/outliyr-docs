# Items

This system provides a robust, flexible, and networked foundation for managing items within your game. It builds upon Lyra's core concepts but significantly extends them to offer a feature-rich solution suitable for complex shooter and RPG mechanics.

### Purpose: Beyond Simple Storage

This inventory system goes far beyond just holding a list of items. It's designed to:

* Define complex item types with modular behaviors (**Fragments**).
* Allow items to store unique, instance-specific data (**Transient Data**).
* Handle sophisticated item interactions (Combining, Attaching).
* Integrate seamlessly and safely with the Gameplay Ability System (**GAS**) for item usage and UI interactions.
* Manage item representation in the game world (**Pickups**).
* Enforce fine-grained access control in multiplayer environments (**Permissions & Access Rights**).
* Provide efficient ways to query and track inventory contents (**Item Query**).
* Support extensibility through external game features (**Fragment Injector**).
* Offer centralized item management (**Global Inventory Manager**).

Essentially, it aims to be the backbone for any gameplay systems involving item acquisition, management, modification, and usage.

### Core Philosophy & Design

The design adheres to several key principles:

* **Modularity via Fragments:** Item functionality is broken down into composable `ULyraInventoryItemFragment`s. Instead of deep inheritance chains, items gain behaviors (like being equippable, consumable, attachable, or having a grid icon) by adding the relevant fragments to their definition.
* **Data-Driven:** Item types (`ULyraInventoryItemDefinition`) and their core behaviors are defined primarily in Data Assets, empowering designers and reducing the need for code changes for simple item variations.
* **Instance-Specific State:** Recognizing that identical items can have different runtime states (e.g., different ammo counts, durability, attachments), the system introduces **Transient Fragments** (`FTransientFragmentData` and `UTransientRuntimeFragment`) allowing `ULyraInventoryItemInstance`s to store unique data beyond simple stack counts.
* **Networked & Secure:** Built for multiplayer, the system uses Unreal's replication features (including `FFastArraySerializer` and subobject replication). It includes **Access Rights** and **Permissions** to control who can see and interact with inventories. Crucially, **GAS integration** is designed to prevent clients from directly manipulating server-side inventory state, using events and data structs for safe communication.
* **Decoupled & Extensible:** Components like the Inventory Manager operate independently of UI. UI interacts via GAS and listens to Gameplay Messages. The **Fragment Injector** allows external plugins (Game Features) to modify existing item definitions non-destructively.

### Major Features & Enhancements

This system includes numerous features beyond a basic inventory:

* **Item Definition & Instance:** Core Lyra concepts maintained.
* **Modular Fragments:** Define item behavior piece by piece (Equippable, Consumable, Attachment, Pickup, Category, Icon, etc.).
* **Transient Data:** Instance-specific data storage via `FTransientFragmentData` (Structs) and `UTransientRuntimeFragment` (UObjects).
* **Runtime Fragments:** UObject-based transient fragments for complex logic and networking needs.
* **Inventory Manager Component:** The primary container with support for limits (Weight, Count, Slots, Item Types) and permission controls.
* **Access Rights & Permissions:** Fine-grained control over inventory visibility and interaction per player.
* **GAS Integration Layer:** Safe UI-to-Server interaction via `UInventoryAbilityFunctionLibrary` and `FAbilityData_SourceItem` structs.
* **Attachment System:** A robust fragment-based system allowing items to have attachments, including nested attachments.
* **Pickup System:** `IPickupable` interface and `ALyraWorldCollectable` actor for representing items in the world.
* **Global Inventory Manager:** Centralized creation of item instances and management of world containers.
* **Item Query System:** Efficiently track specific items in an inventory using `ULyraInventoryQuery` and `UAsyncAction_ItemQuery`.
* **Fragment Injector:** Allows Game Features/Plugins to add fragments to existing item definitions at runtime.

### Key Components at a Glance

* **`ULyraInventoryItemDefinition`:** The static definition (template) of an item type.
* **`ULyraInventoryItemInstance`:** A runtime instance of an item, holding unique state (Stat Tags, Transient/Runtime Fragments).
* **`ULyraInventoryItemFragment`:** Base class for modular item behaviors/data added to Definitions.
  * `FTransientFragmentData` / `UTransientRuntimeFragment`: Bases for instance-specific data/logic.
* **`ULyraInventoryManagerComponent`:** The Actor Component that holds and manages a list of items (`FLyraInventoryList`). Enforces rules, permissions, and replication.
* **`UInventoryAbilityFunctionLibrary`:** Provides Blueprint functions for safe GAS interaction (UI -> Server).
* **`FAbilityData_SourceItem` (and derivatives):** Structs used to safely identify item locations (Inventory, Equipment, Attachment) when triggering GAS abilities.
* **`IPickupable` / `ALyraWorldCollectable`:** Interface and Actor for world item representation and pickup logic.
* **`UGlobalInventoryManager`:** GameState Component for central item creation and world container tracking.
* **`ULyraInventoryQuery` / `UAsyncAction_ItemQuery`:** Classes for tracking inventory contents efficiently.
* **`UFragmentInjector` / `UFragmentInjectorManager`:** System for modularly adding fragments from plugins.

{% hint style="info" %}
This example uses the inventory manager component, but the gameplay ability could call other components like the quickbar component or equipment component. It can even have it's own logic inside.
