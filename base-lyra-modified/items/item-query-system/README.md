# Item Query System

In many gameplay systems, it's not enough to do a one-time check for an item in a player's inventoryâ€”you often need to continuously track the presence or quantity of specific items as they change in real-time. Examples include:

* A **weapon system** tracking compatible ammo as the player picks up or uses it.
* A **crafting system** dynamically updating available recipes as the player's resources change.
* A **quest system** monitoring whether required objective items have been acquired or consumed.
* A **HUD** reflecting the current count of consumables or power-ups.

While one-time queries can be handled directly using functions from `ULyraInventoryManagerComponent`, which can discussed in more detail [here](../inventory-manager-component/advanced-operations.md#searching-and-querying), doing this repeatedly (e.g., polling every frame or on a timer) is inefficient and error-prone. It also fails to react instantly to inventory changes.

### Enter the Item Query System

The **Item Query System** is designed to solve this problem by providing an efficient, reactive mechanism to **subscribe to and track specific item types** within a given inventory. Instead of polling, it automatically notifies you when relevant changes occur.

#### Purpose: Efficient & Reactive Tracking

The core goals of the Item Query system are:

* **Efficiency:** Avoid the performance cost of repeatedly iterating through the entire inventory list just to find specific items.
* **Reactivity:** Automatically notify interested listeners _when_ the status of the tracked items changes (added, removed, stack count modified), rather than requiring constant polling.
* **Simplicity:** Provide easy-to-use C++ and Blueprint interfaces for setting up and listening to these tracked queries.

#### Core Concept: Listening for Changes

Instead of active polling, the Item Query system works by:

1. **Defining a Query:** You specify which `ULyraInventoryManagerComponent` to monitor and which `ULyraInventoryItemDefinition`(s) you are interested in tracking.
2. **Initial Scan:** The system performs an initial scan of the target inventory to find all existing instances matching the tracked definitions.
3. **Listening:** It then subscribes to the `TAG_Lyra_Inventory_Message_StackChanged` Gameplay Message broadcast by the target inventory component.
4. **Reactive Updates:** When a `StackChanged` message arrives, the query checks if the changed item instance matches one of the tracked definitions. If it does, the query updates its internal cached list of matching items and broadcasts an "updated" event to its listeners.

### Key Components

* **`ULyraInventoryQuery` (UObject):**
  * The underlying C++ class that performs the tracking logic.
  * It holds the reference to the target inventory, the set of tracked item definitions, and the cached list of matching item instances.
  * It registers itself as a listener for the `StackChanged` message.
  * Exposes delegates (`OnUpdated`, `OnUpdatedWithTrackedDefs`) that fire when the tracked item set changes.
* **`UAsyncAction_ItemQuery` (Async Action Blueprint Node):**
  * A Blueprint-friendly wrapper around `ULyraInventoryQuery`.
  * Provides an easy-to-use async node (`QueryInventoryAsync`) for Blueprints (like Widgets or Actor Components) to start tracking items.
  * Exposes Blueprint event delegates (`OnUpdated`, `OnFirstResult`, `OnFailed`) that are triggered by the underlying query. It also conveniently calculates and provides the total stack count across all found items.

### Benefits

* **Performance:** Significantly more performant than manual polling, especially for large inventories or frequent checks.
* **Real-time Updates:** Ensures systems react immediately to relevant inventory changes.
* **Decoupling:** The system querying the inventory doesn't need intimate knowledge of the inventory's internal list structure beyond setting up the query.
