# Lyra Indicator System

The UI Indicator System in Lyra is a foundational framework for providing players with clear, contextual visual cues about important game elements. Its primary function is to display dynamic UI elements (indicators) that can track actors, components, or specific points in the game world, projecting their location onto the player's screen. This is crucial for maintaining player awareness, especially for elements that might be off-screen or require special emphasis, such as distant objectives, incoming threats, or interactive items.

### **Core Philosophy & Design Goals**

The design of Lyra's UI Indicator System is built upon several key philosophies to ensure it is robust, flexible, and understandable:

* **Separation of Concerns:** A fundamental principle is the clear division of responsibilities:
  * **Data & Configuration (`UIndicatorDescriptor`):** This component defines _what_ an indicator represents, _where_ it points, its visual properties (like the UMG widget class to use), and its behavior (e.g., clamping to screen edges, visibility rules, 2D screen-lock).
  * **Visual Representation (UMG Widgets implementing `IIndicatorWidgetInterface`):** These are the actual UI elements displayed to the player. They are responsible for their appearance and reacting to state changes communicated by the system (like being clamped or switching between 3D and 2D modes).
  * **Management (`ULyraIndicatorManagerComponent`):** This acts as a central registry, tracking all active indicators associated with a player controller.
  * **Rendering & Projection Logic (`SActorCanvas` and `FIndicatorProjection`):** These Slate-level components handle the complex task of taking a 3D world position, projecting it onto the 2D viewport, managing the layout of multiple indicators, and rendering them efficiently.
* **Modularity and Extensibility:** The system is designed to be easily extended. Developers can create new types of indicators with unique visual styles and behaviors by defining new `UIndicatorDescriptor` configurations and UMG widgets, without needing to modify the core projection or management logic significantly.
* **Performance-Minded:** Features like UMG widget pooling (`FUserWidgetPool` within `SActorCanvas`) are implemented to manage the creation and destruction of UI elements efficiently, especially in scenarios with many dynamic indicators.
* **Data-Driven Behavior:** Much of an indicator's behavior is configured through its `UIndicatorDescriptor`, allowing for diverse indicator types to be set up primarily through data.
* **Clear Communication Channels:** Interactions between the core system and the UMG widgets are facilitated by the `IIndicatorWidgetInterface` interface, ensuring a well-defined contract for how widgets bind to indicator data and respond to system events.
* **Leveraging Unreal Engine & Lyra Strengths:** The system effectively utilizes UMG for visual design and Blueprint accessibility, Slate for high-performance low-level UI rendering, and Lyra's component-based architecture.

The overarching goal is to provide a system that is powerful enough for complex scenarios while remaining understandable enough for developers to confidently customize and build upon. It aims to give a holistic view of how these different parts—data definition, visual presentation, and screen projection—come together to create a cohesive UI indicator experience.
