# Defining Equippable Items

This section explains how you define the _behavior_ and _visuals_ of items when they are equipped by a character. The system uses a data-driven approach, primarily centered around two key assets:

1. **`UInventoryFragment_EquippableItem`**: A small piece added to your _inventory item definition_.
2. **`ULyraEquipmentDefinition`**: A dedicated `UObject` detailing the equipment-specific properties.

Think of it like this: The inventory item knows _what_ it is (a rifle, a helmet), and the `UInventoryFragment_EquippableItem` acts as a signpost saying, "Hey, I'm equippable! Look over _here_ (`ULyraEquipmentDefinition`) for the details on _how_ I work when equipped, including which slots I can go into."

***

### The Bridge: `UInventoryFragment_EquippableItem`

Before the Equipment System can do anything with an inventory item, that item needs to explicitly state that it _can_ be equipped. This is done by adding the `UInventoryFragment_EquippableItem` fragment to the item's `ULyraInventoryItemDefinition`.

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (86).png" alt="" title="Pistol Item Definition pointing to EquipmentDefinition WID_Pistol ">

**Purpose:**

* **Flags the item as equippable:** Tells the `ULyraEquipmentManagerComponent` that this item type can potentially be processed.
* **Links to the Equipment Definition:** Contains the crucial pointer to the `ULyraEquipmentDefinition` asset that holds all the specific equipment behavior.

**Key Property:**

* `Equipment Definition` (`TSubclassOf<ULyraEquipmentDefinition>`): **This is the most important field.** Assign the specific `ULyraEquipmentDefinition` asset (which you'll create next, e.g., `ED_Rifle`) that defines this item's equipped behavior.

**How to Add:**

1. Open the `ULyraInventoryItemDefinition` Blueprint for the item you want to make equippable (e.g., `ID_Rifle`).
2. In the **Details** panel, find the `Fragments` array property.
3. Click the **+** (Add Element) button.
4. In the dropdown for the new fragment element, search for and select `InventoryFragment_EquippableItem`.
5. Expand the newly added fragment.

### The Recipe: `ULyraEquipmentDefinition`

This Data Asset is where you define _everything_ about how an item behaves once it's managed by the `ULyraEquipmentManagerComponent`.

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (87).png" alt="" title="Pistol EquipmentDefinition WID_Pistol">

**Key Properties Breakdown:**

1. **`Instance Type` (`TSubclassOf<ULyraEquipmentInstance>`)**
   * Specifies the C++ or Blueprint class to be instantiated at runtime when this item is equipped.
   * Defaults to `ULyraEquipmentInstance`.
   * You can create subclasses of `ULyraEquipmentInstance` (e.g., `B_WeaponInstance`, `B_ArmorInstance`) if you need custom Blueprint logic (like handling ammo display) or specific C++ functionality tied to the _runtime instance_ of the equipment. Leave as default if you don't need custom instance logic.
2. **`Equipment Slot Details` (Map: `FEquipmentSlotTagKey` -> `FLyraEquipmentDetails`)**
   * **Purpose:** Defines behavior when the item is **Holstered** in a specific slot. This `TMap` is central to the system's slot flexibility. You are not limited to a predefined set of slots. By adding new `FEquipmentSlotTagKey` entries to this map (which internally represent specific `FGameplayTag`s), you effectively define new potential equipment slots that the `ULyraEquipmentManagerComponent` can manage for _this specific item type_. The manager itself does not impose any restrictions on these tags beyond what is defined here.
   * **The Key (`FEquipmentSlotTagKey`):**
     * This is a custom struct specifically designed to hold an `FGameplayTag` intended for an equipment slot.
     * **Crucially, `FEquipmentSlotTagKey` is configured in C++ to filter the Gameplay Tag picker in the Unreal Editor. When you assign a tag to this key, the editor will only show you `GameplayTag`s that are children of a predefined parent tag (i.e., `Lyra.Equipment.Slot`).**
     * This ensures that all equipment slot tags adhere to a consistent hierarchy (like `Lyra.Equipment.Slot.Weapon.Primary`, `Lyra.Equipment.Slot.Armor.Helmet`), preventing typos and miscategorization. While the runtime system uses the underlying `FGameplayTag`, the struct provides this essential editor-time safety and organization.
   * **The Value (`FLyraEquipmentDetails`):**
     * `Ability Sets To Grant` (`TArray<ULyraAbilitySet*>`): Ability Sets (GAS) to grant _only_ when the item is holstered in this specific slot.
     * `Actors To Spawn` (`TArray<FLyraEquipmentActorToSpawn>`): Actors to spawn and attach _only_ when the item is holstered in this specific slot.
       * `ActorToSpawn` (`TSubclassOf<AActor>`): The Blueprint or C++ Actor class to spawn.
       * `Attach Socket` (`FName`): The socket name on the Pawn's mesh.
       * `Attach Transform` (`FTransform`): Relative offset/rotation/scale.
     * **`Input Mappings` (`TArray<FPawnInputMappingContextAndPriority>`):** Input Mapping Contexts (Enhanced Input) to add to the player's input system _only when the item is holstered in this specific slot_. This is useful for defining passive inputs that are always available when an item is equipped but not actively held, that might not fit the generic input mapping for the hero's pawn data.
     * **`Input Config` (`ULyraInputConfig`):** A Lyra Input Config asset to add to the player's input system _only when the item is holstered in this specific slot_. This provides the mapping between input actions and gameplay input tags.
   * _Example:_ For `ED_Rifle`, you might add an entry where the `FEquipmentSlotTagKey` holds the `Lyra.Equipment.Slot.Weapon.Back` tag. The `FLyraEquipmentDetails` for this entry might specify spawning a `BP_RifleMesh_OnBack` actor attached to a `spine_socket`, and possibly adding an `IMC_WeaponHolstered` for a quick-swap action.
3. **`bCanBeHeld` (`bool`)**
   * A simple flag determining if this piece of equipment can be actively wielded by the player (transitioned to the "Held" state).
   * Set to `true` for items like weapons or tools that the player actively uses.
   * Set to `false` for items like armor, helmets, or passive charms that are only ever "Holstered".
   * The `ULyraEquipmentManagerComponent::HoldItem` function will fail if this is `false`.
4. **`Active Equipment Details` (`FLyraEquipmentDetails`)**
   * **Purpose:** Defines behavior when the item is actively **Held**. This section is ignored if `bCanBeHeld` is `false`.
   * `Ability Sets To Grant`: Ability Sets (GAS) to grant _only when the item is held_. This is where you'd typically grant abilities like `GA_FireWeapon`, `GA_Reload`, `GA_AimDownSights`.
   * `Actors To Spawn`: Actors to spawn and attach _only when the item is held_. This is typically where you'd spawn the main weapon mesh that attaches to the character's hands (e.g., `BP_RifleMesh_InHands` attached to `hand_r_socket`).
   * **`Input Mappings` (`TArray<FPawnInputMappingContextAndPriority>`):** Input Mapping Contexts (Enhanced Input) to add to the player's input system _only when the item is held_. This is useful for defining active inputs specific to that equipment, that might not fit the generic input mapping for the hero's pawn data.
   * **`Input Config` (`ULyraInputConfig`):** A Lyra Input Config asset to add to the player's input system _only when the item is held_. This provides the mapping between input actions and gameplay input tags for active weapon use.

> [!SUCCESS]
> When it comes to input mapping and input config, you would rarely use this functionality. For inputs that are generic and can be shared amongst equipment they are better going in the player's pawn data. An example would be weapon firing and reloading, this is generic and would be better served in the hero's input mapping and input config.

**How to Create:**

1. In the Content Browser, right-click -> Blueprint -> BlueprintClass.
2. Choose `LyraEquipmentDefinition` as the parent class.
3. Give it a descriptive name, often prefixed with `ED_` (e.g., `ED_Rifle`, `ED_Helmet`).

> [!INFO]
> Weapon Equipment Definition in ShooterBase are prefixed with `WID_`  (Weapon Item Definition), this is what Lyra used so I stuck with it.

### Workflow: Creating a New Equippable Item

Here's the typical process from start to finish:

1. **Define Gameplay Tags (If Needed):** Ensure you have `FGameplayTag`s defined for any new equipment slots you require (e.g., in `Config/DefaultGameplayTags.ini`). Example: `Equipment.Slot.Gadget.Hip`.
2. **Create Inventory Item Definition (`ULyraInventoryItemDefinition`):**
   * Create your base inventory item (e.g., `ID_Gadget_GrapplingHook`). Set up display name, etc.
3. **Create Equipment Definition (`ULyraEquipmentDefinition`):**
   * Create the Data Asset (e.g., `ED_Gadget_GrapplingHook`).
   * Configure its properties:
     * Decide if it needs a custom `Instance Type`.
     * Add entries to `Equipment Slot Details` for relevant slots (e.g., map `Equipment.Slot.Gadget.Hip` to details specifying a holstered mesh actor `BP_Grapple_Holstered`).
     * Set `bCanBeHeld` (likely `true` for a grappling hook).
     * Configure `Active Equipment Details` (grant `GA_FireGrapple` ability, spawn `BP_Grapple_InHand` actor).
4. **Link Item to Equipment Definition:**
   * Open the `ID_Gadget_GrapplingHook` asset.
   * Add the `InventoryFragment_EquippableItem` fragment.
   * Assign your newly created `ED_Gadget_GrapplingHook` to the `Equipment Definition` property within the fragment.
5. **Create Actors & Ability Sets:** Create the necessary Actor Blueprints (`BP_Grapple_Holstered`, `BP_Grapple_InHand`) and Gameplay Ability Sets (`GAS_GrappleAbilities`) referenced in the `ULyraEquipmentDefinition`.
6. **Test:** Use the `ULyraEquipmentManagerComponent` (e.g., via debug commands or gameplay logic) to equip the `ID_Gadget_GrapplingHook` to the `Equipment.Slot.Gadget.Hip` slot, then try holding it to verify actors spawn correctly and abilities are granted.

### Example Configurations

Let's contrast a typical weapon and a piece of armor:

**Example 1: `ED_AssaultRifle`**

* `Instance Type`: `B_WeaponInstance` (Custom BP class to handle ammo display).
* `Equipment Slot Details`:
  * Key: `Lyra.Equipment.Slot.Weapon.Primary` -> Value: Spawn `BP_RifleMesh_Holstered` on `back_socket`, no abilities.
  * Key: `Lyra.Equipment.Slot.Weapon.Secondary` -> Value: Spawn `BP_RifleMesh_Holstered` on `hip_socket`, no abilities.
* `bCanBeHeld`: `true`.
* `Active Equipment Details`:
  * `Ability Sets`: Grant `GAS_RifleFiringAbilities` (containing Shoot, Reload, Aim).
  * `Actors`: Spawn `BP_RifleMesh_InHands` on `hand_r_socket`.

**Example 2: `ED_HeavyHelmet`**

* `Instance Type`: `ULyraEquipmentInstance` (Default, no special instance logic needed).
* `Equipment Slot Details`:
  * Key: `Lyra.Equipment.Slot.Armor.Head` -> Value: Spawn `BP_HelmetMesh` on `head_socket`, Grant `GAS_HelmetPassiveStats` (e.g., containing a passive ability applying damage resistance).
* `bCanBeHeld`: `false`.
* `Active Equipment Details`: (Ignored because `bCanBeHeld` is false).

By configuring these assets, you control precisely how items transition from the inventory into functional, visible parts of your character's loadout. The next section will detail the `ULyraEquipmentManagerComponent`, which reads these definitions and brings them to life at runtime.
