# Practical Guides & How-Tos

Understanding the components and flow of Lyra's input system is one thing; applying that knowledge to achieve specific outcomes is another. This section provides step-by-step practical guides for common input-related development tasks you might encounter while working with Lyra or a Lyra-based asset.

These guides aim to consolidate the information from previous pages into actionable workflows.

**Common Input Development Scenarios:**

The following "How-To" guides will walk you through the process of:

1. **Adding a New Input to Trigger a Gameplay Ability:**
   * This is perhaps the most common task: making a new key press or button input activate a specific character ability.
2. **Adding a New Native Input Binding (Non-Ability):**
   * For actions that are better suited to direct C++ function calls rather than the Gameplay Ability System (e.g., simple character interactions, UI toggles).
3. **Changing Default Sensitivity or Deadzone Values:**
   * Adjusting the out-of-the-box feel for gamepad controls.

Each guide will break down the necessary steps, referencing the relevant Data Assets and C++ classes involved.
