# Extending the Camera System

The camera system, built around the `ULyraCameraModeStack`, is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind. Whether you need to tweak the existing third-person view, create entirely new camera perspectives, or dynamically change the camera based on gameplay events, this page provides guidance on common extension points.

> [!WARNING]
> You _can_ create new camera modes entirely in Blueprint by subclassing `ULyraCameraMode`, but for performance reasons — since camera logic runs every frame — I recommend using C++ for custom camera behavior.

### Creating Custom Camera Modes

The most powerful way to customize camera behavior is by creating new classes derived from `ULyraCameraMode`. This allows you to define entirely new perspectives or camera logic.

**Steps (C++ recommended):**

1. **Create a New Class:** Create a new C++ class inheriting from `ULyraCameraMode`. Let's call it `UMyCustomCameraMode`.
2. **Override `UpdateView`:** This is the most critical step. Implement the logic inside `UpdateView(float DeltaTime)` to calculate the desired camera `Location`, `Rotation`, `ControlRotation`, and `FieldOfView` for your custom mode. Store the results in the inherited `View` member (type `FLyraCameraModeView`).
   * You can get the target actor using `GetTargetActor()`.
   * You can use or override `GetPivotLocation()` and `GetPivotRotation()` to define the reference point for your calculations.
   * Consider player input (e.g., `GetTargetActor()->GetController()->GetControlRotation()`), target velocity, or specific gameplay states in your calculations.
   * Remember to clamp pitch using `ViewPitchMin` and `ViewPitchMax` if applicable.
3. **Set Default Properties:** In the constructor (`UMyCustomCameraMode::UMyCustomCameraMode()`), set appropriate default values for:
   * `FieldOfView`
   * `ViewPitchMin`, `ViewPitchMax`
   * `BlendTime` (How long to blend in? 0 for instant snap)
   * `BlendFunction` (e.g., `ELyraCameraModeBlendFunction::EaseInOut`)
   * `BlendExponent`
   * `CameraTypeTag` (A generic tag, e.g., `Camera.Type.FirstPerson`)
   * `CameraTagToAddToPlayer` (A specific tag, e.g., `Camera.View.FirstPerson`)
4. **Implement Activation/Deactivation (Optional):** Override `OnActivation()` and `OnDeactivation()` if your mode needs specific setup (e.g., initializing internal variables, attaching temporary components) or cleanup when it becomes active or inactive. Remember to call `Super::OnActivation()` / `Super::OnDeactivation()` if you want the base tag-adding/removing behavior.
5. **Compile:** Build your C++ code.
6. **Usage:** Your new `UMyCustomCameraMode` class can now be used like any other mode – assigned as a default, pushed onto the stack via code, or selected by the `DetermineCameraModeDelegate`.

#### **Example Idea: First-Person Mode**&#xD;

A first-person `ULyraCameraMode` might override `UpdateView` to position the camera directly at the result of `GetPivotLocation()` (which accounts for eye height) and set the `View.Rotation` directly from the pawn's `GetViewRotation()`. It might also have a shorter `BlendTime` and different `FieldOfView` compared to the third-person mode.

### Modifying Existing Modes

You don't always need to create a mode from scratch. You can modify existing ones:

1. **Blueprint Inheritance:** Create a new Blueprint class that inherits from an existing C++ camera mode (like `ULyraCameraMode_ThirdPerson`).
2. **Adjust Properties:** In the Blueprint's Class Defaults, you can easily tweak properties exposed from the C++ class:
   * Change `FieldOfView`.
   * Adjust `BlendTime`, `BlendFunction`, `BlendExponent`.
   * Assign a different `TargetOffsetCurve`.
   * Modify penetration avoidance settings (`bPreventPenetration`, `PenetrationBlendIn/OutTime`, `PenetrationAvoidanceFeelers` array, etc.).
   * Change the Gameplay Tags (`CameraTypeTag`, `CameraTagToAddToPlayer`).
3. **Override Functions (Limited):** While you can override Blueprint-accessible functions, core logic like `UpdateView` is often best kept in C++ for performance and complexity management.

This Blueprint approach is ideal for creating variations of existing modes (e.g., a third-person mode with a different offset curve or faster blending) without writing new C++ code.

### Switching Base Camera Modes Dynamically

The primary camera mode (the one typically at the bottom of the stack) is usually determined contextually based on gameplay.

1. **The Delegate:** The `ULyraCameraComponent` uses its `DetermineCameraModeDelegate` to query for the appropriate `TSubclassOf<ULyraCameraMode>`.
2. **The Provider (`ULyraHeroComponent`):** On player-controlled Pawns, the `ULyraHeroComponent` typically binds its `DetermineCameraMode` function to this delegate during initialization.
3. **Custom Logic:** Modify the `ULyraHeroComponent::DetermineCameraMode` function (or create your own component that binds to the delegate):
   * Check game state: Is the player aiming? Sprinting? In a specific vehicle? Interacting with an object?
   * Check active Gameplay Abilities: Does the player have an ability active that requires a specific camera view (e.g., an aiming ability)? Use `AbilitySystemComponent->GetTagCount` or check for specific ability spec handles.
   *   Return the appropriate `TSubclassOf<ULyraCameraMode>` based on the current context. For example:

       ```cpp
       // Inside a function bound to DetermineCameraModeDelegate
       if (IsPlayerAimingDownSights()) // Check GAS or input state
       {
           return AimingCameraModeClass; // TSubclassOf<ULyraCameraMode_Aiming>
       }
       else
       {
           // Fallback to default from PawnData or a hardcoded default
           if (const ULyraPawnData* PawnData = GetPawnData())
           {
                return PawnData->DefaultCameraMode; // TSubclassOf<ULyraCameraMode_ThirdPerson>
           }
           return DefaultThirdPersonModeClass;
       }
       ```
4. **Result:** When the context changes (player starts/stops aiming), the delegate returns a different class. The `ULyraCameraComponent` calls `PushCameraMode` with the new class, and the stack handles blending smoothly to the new perspective.

### Temporary Camera Mode Overrides in Lyra

Gameplay systems such as abilities, interactions, or cinematics may need to temporarily override the active camera mode (e.g., switching to a scoped view or cinematic camera). In Lyra, this is **not done via direct calls to `PushCameraMode()`** on the camera component, because:

* The camera stack is updated every frame by `DetermineCameraModeDelegate`, which is **bound by default to the `ULyraHeroComponent`**.
* Any manually pushed mode will be immediately replaced by whatever the delegate returns.

#### Recommended Approach

To temporarily override the camera mode in a Lyra-compatible way, use the built-in support provided by `ULyraHeroComponent`. This component maintains an internal `AbilityCameraMode` that the delegate will prioritize when present.

#### How it Works

* `DetermineCameraModeDelegate` is bound to `ULyraHeroComponent::DetermineCameraMode()`.
* When an ability wants to change the camera mode, it should call:
  * `SetCameraMode(CameraModeClass)` — sets a temporary override.
  * `ClearCameraMode()` — restores the default mode set by the [PawnData](../gameframework-and-experience/experience-primary-assets/lyrapawndata.md).
* These functions are available in both C++ and Blueprint via `ULyraGameplayAbility`.

#### Setting a Temporary Camera Mode

In your **Lyra Gameplay Ability** Blueprint:

* Use the **Set Camera Mode** node to activate a specific camera mode

#### Clearing the Camera Mode

At the end of your ability (Or when you want to go back to the default camera mode), clear the override:

* Use the **Clear Camera Mode** node to go back to the default camera mode.

### Implementing `ILyraCameraAssistInterface`

To fine-tune how the third-person camera interacts with specific actors, especially regarding penetration:

1. **Choose Actor:** Decide which actor should provide hints (e.g., the player character Blueprint, a vehicle Blueprint).
2. **Implement Interface:** Add `ILyraCameraAssistInterface` to the class (C++ inheritance or Blueprint Class Settings -> Interfaces).
3. **Implement Functions:**
   * **`GetIgnoredActorsForCameraPentration`:** Add actors (like self, maybe a parent vehicle) to the output array that the camera sweeps should ignore.
   * **`GetCameraPreventPenetrationTarget`:** If the penetration checks should focus on a different actor than `Self` (e.g., a mount the character is riding), return that actor here. Otherwise, return an empty `TOptional`.
   * **`OnCameraPenetratingTarget`:** Implement the desired reaction (e.g., hide mesh components, start a fade material effect) when the camera notifies this actor that it's very close due to collisions.

### Advanced Customization

While less common, further customization is possible:

* **Custom `APlayerCameraManager`:** Inherit from `ALyraPlayerCameraManager` to add custom logic for view target selection, post-processing, or camera shakes beyond what the mode stack provides.
* **Custom `ULyraUICameraManagerComponent`:** Enhance the UI component to actively control the camera during `UpdateViewTarget` if complex UI-driven camera behaviors are needed.
* **New Blend Functions:** Adding new `ELyraCameraModeBlendFunction` options typically requires modifying engine source code or implementing a custom blending mechanism outside the existing enum/switch statements within the stack.

By leveraging these extension points, you can tailor the camera system extensively to fit the specific needs and feel of your shooter game.
