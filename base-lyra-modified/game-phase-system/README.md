# Game Phase System

This subsystem provides a powerful and flexible framework for managing the different stages, states, or "phases" of your gameplay session using Gameplay Tags and the Gameplay Ability System (GAS).

### Purpose

Most games progress through distinct stages â€“ think of a match starting with a setup period, moving into active play, perhaps hitting overtime or sudden death, and finally concluding with a scoreboard display. The Game Phase System aims to:

* **Structure Game Flow:** Define and manage these distinct phases in a clear, organized manner.
* **Decouple Logic:** Allow various game systems (UI, AI, spawning, objectives) to react to the current phase without needing complex, hardcoded dependencies on the game mode's state machine.
* **Enable Reactivity:** Provide an event-driven way for systems to be notified when specific phases begin or end.
* **Support Complex Flows:** Handle nested or parallel phases gracefully using a hierarchical tag system (e.g., being in a general "Playing" phase while also being in a specific "Playing.CaptureTheFlag" sub-phase).

Instead of relying solely on complex state variables within your Game Mode, this system uses Gameplay Abilities activated on the GameState to represent the active phase(s), orchestrated by a dedicated World Subsystem.

### Core Concept: Phases as Abilities & Tags

The system revolves around these key ideas:

1. **Phases are Abilities:** Each distinct game phase (e.g., "WaitingToStart", "Playing", "RoundOver") is represented by a dedicated Gameplay Ability class derived from `ULyraGamePhaseAbility`.
2. **Phases are Activated on GameState:** These phase abilities are granted to and activated on the GameState's Ability System Component (ASC). An _active_ phase ability signifies that the game is currently _in_ that phase.
3. **Tags Define Hierarchy:** Each `ULyraGamePhaseAbility` is assigned a specific Gameplay Tag (e.g., `GamePhase.Playing`, `GamePhase.Playing.SuddenDeath`) via its `GamePhaseTag` property. The **structure** of these tags (using parent.child conventions) defines the relationship between phases.
4. **Subsystem Manages Transitions:** A World Subsystem, `ULyraGamePhaseSubsystem`, manages the activation and cancellation of these phase abilities. When a new phase ability is started, the subsystem intelligently ends conflicting sibling phases based on the Gameplay Tag hierarchy, while allowing parent phases to remain active.
5. **Systems Observe Phases:** Other game systems subscribe to the `ULyraGamePhaseSubsystem` to be notified when specific phases (identified by their tags) start or end, allowing them to react accordingly.

### Key Benefits

* **Structured Flow:** Provides a clear, tag-based definition of your game's lifecycle.
* **Decoupling:** Game systems react to phase tags, not direct Game Mode state checks, improving modularity.
* **Event-Driven:** Use delegates (`WhenPhaseStartsOrIsActive`, `WhenPhaseEnds`) for efficient, reactive updates instead of constant polling.
* **Hierarchical Logic:** Naturally handles nested states (e.g., general 'Playing' vs specific 'Playing.SuddenDeath') and ensures only relevant phases are cancelled during transitions.
* **Extensibility:** Easily add new phases by creating new tags and `ULyraGamePhaseAbility` subclasses.
* **GAS Integration:** Leverages the power and familiarity of the Gameplay Ability System.

### Key Components Intro

* **`ULyraGamePhaseSubsystem`:** The central manager (a `UWorldSubsystem`). Tracks active phases, handles transitions, and notifies observers.
* **`ULyraGamePhaseAbility`:** The base class for all phase abilities. Each instance represents an active phase and holds the defining `GamePhaseTag`.
* **Gameplay Tags:** The backbone of the system. Their hierarchical structure (e.g., `GamePhase.Playing.Standard`) dictates the transition logic.

### High-Level Flow Example

Imagine a simple match flow:

1. **Start `GamePhase.Warmup`:** The game begins, `Warmup` phase ability activates. Game systems listening for `GamePhase.Warmup` might initialize spawn points or display pre-round UI.
2. **Start `GamePhase.Playing`:** When setup is complete, the `Playing` phase ability is activated.
   * The `ULyraGamePhaseSubsystem` sees that `GamePhase.Playing` is not an ancestor of the currently active `GamePhase.Setup`.
   * It automatically ends the `GamePhase.Setup` ability.
   * The `GamePhase.Playing` ability becomes active.
   * Systems listening for `GamePhase.Playing` might enable player input and objectives, while systems listening for `GamePhase.Setup` ending might hide pre-round UI.
3. **Start `GamePhase.Playing.SuddenDeath`:** If the match goes into overtime, the `SuddenDeath` phase ability is activated.
   * The subsystem sees that the currently active `GamePhase.Playing` _is_ an ancestor of `GamePhase.Playing.SuddenDeath`.
   * `GamePhase.Playing` **remains active**.
   * `GamePhase.Playing.SuddenDeath` also becomes active.
   * Systems listening for `GamePhase.Playing.SuddenDeath` might apply special rules or UI elements, while systems relying on the general `GamePhase.Playing` continue functioning.
4. **Start `GamePhase.PostGame`:** When the match concludes, the `PostGame` phase ability is activated.
   * The subsystem sees that neither `GamePhase.Playing` nor `GamePhase.Playing.SuddenDeath` are ancestors of `GamePhase.PostGame`.
   * It automatically ends both the `GamePhase.Playing` and `GamePhase.Playing.SuddenDeath` abilities.
   * `GamePhase.PostGame` becomes active.
   * Systems listening for `GamePhase.PostGame` might display the scoreboard, while systems reacting to `GamePhase.Playing` ending might disable player input.
