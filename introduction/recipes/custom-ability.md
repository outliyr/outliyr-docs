# Custom Ability

## What you're building

Two worked examples teaching the two ability authoring patterns:

1. **Sniper ADS**, the **subclass-and-configure** pattern. Subclass the existing `GA_ADS` ability and set two property values. No graph edits, no overrides, the parent already wires the lifecycle. The textbook case for parameterisable variants where only data changes between siblings.
2. **Stim Injection,** where an ability is created **from-scratch**. Subclass `ULyraGameplayAbility` directly, author the `Activate` graph, apply a buff Gameplay Effect, wire a custom input, and call `EndAbility` when the buff duration expires. The textbook case for genuinely new behaviour no parent ability covers.

Together they cover the two patterns: subclass when only properties vary, build from scratch when the behaviour is new. The Sniper ADS recipe pairs with the sniper variant from the [Custom Weapon Recipe](custom-weapon.md); Stim Injection stands alone as a teaching example for the lifecycle (Activate → work → `EndAbility`) you'll use any time the framework doesn't already have a parent for what you're building.

By the end you'll know:

* When to subclass an existing ability vs. build one from scratch
* How to use a parent ability's Class Defaults properties to vary behaviour without writing code (Sniper ADS)
* The full Activate → work → `EndAbility` lifecycle for from-scratch abilities, including cooldowns and duration-based effects (Stim Injection)
* The common pitfalls that break abilities in subtle, multiplayer-only ways

> [!INFO]
> This recipe assumes you've completed the [Quick Start Guide](../quick-start-guide.md), have a [Game Feature Plugin](../installing-and-setup.md) of your own, and have read [Abilities](../../base-lyra-modified/gas/abilities.md) and [Ability Sets](../../base-lyra-modified/gas/abilities.md) at a glance.

***

## First: see what already exists

Before you build _anything_ as a custom ability, check whether the framework already ships something close. Common abilities you might already have a base for:

* **`GA_ADS`** — generic aim-down-sights (the parent for this recipe)
* **`GA_Grenade`** — throw arc, cookable, AoE damage
* **`GA_Melee`** — melee strike
* **`GA_Weapon_Fire_Hitscan` / `_BulletDrop` / `_Projectile`** — firing models for guns
* **`GA_Weapon_Reload_Magazine` / `_Shells`** — magazine and shell-by-shell reloads
* **`GA_Weapon_Inspect`** — weapon inspection animation
* **`GA_Emote`**, **`GA_DropHoldingItem`**, **`GA_QuickbarSlots`** — common input-driven abilities
* **`GA_PlaceObject`**, **`GAB_ShowWidget_WhenInputPressed`**, **`GAB_ShowWidget_WhileInputHeld`** — utility patterns

Once you know what's there, you have three approaches:

1. **Subclass and configure** — when only property values change between your variant and an existing ability. The activation logic and lifecycle are identical; only data differs. The Sniper ADS in this recipe is the textbook case (only camera mode and widget change between weapons), and the same is true for weapon-specific firing or reload variants where the parent already parameterises the differences.
2. **Standalone ability** — when the _behaviour_ itself differs. A new reload mechanism, a new firing model, anything where activation flow or end conditions don't match an existing parent. Don't subclass and try to override; write it as its own thing. Copying an existing ability as a starting template is a fine shortcut when something close enough exists, the copy lives as a standalone ability, not as a subclass.
3. **Build from scratch** — when nothing's even close to copy from.

**The default for genuinely new behaviour is standalone.** Subclassing is the right tool only when the variation is parameterisable.

***

## The shape of an ability

A Gameplay Ability is a self-contained chunk of "something the pawn can do." At runtime it has a small lifecycle:

1. **Granted** — added to the pawn's Ability System Component, usually through an Ability Set referenced from a Pawn Data or an Equipment Definition.
2. **Activated** — by an input, by a gameplay event, or by another ability. The framework checks ability tags, blocking tags, and trigger conditions before letting the activation through.
3. **Runs** — your code in `Activate` (in C++ or Blueprint). You apply Gameplay Effects, push camera modes, play montages, spawn projectiles, modify state.
4. **Ends** — _you_ are responsible for calling `EndAbility`. The framework cleans up effects/montages tagged as ability-owned.

Abilities are flexible, there are no strict constraints on what you put in C++ vs. Blueprint. The default shooter abilities live in C++ but expose relevant properties to Blueprint while inventory abililties are made entirely with blueprints, so you can subclass either way. Use whichever you're faster in.

## Worked Example #1 — Sniper ADS (subclass and configure)

You have a sniper rifle from the weapon recipe. It currently uses the generic `GA_ADS` ability granted by the default rifle's ability set, pulls up a slight FOV zoom, no scope view. We're going to give it a proper scope.

The asset graph for this is small:

```
GA_ADS_Sniper (Gameplay Ability — subclass of GA_ADS, no graph edits)
 └─ Class Defaults:
      ├─ Camera Mode ........... → CM_SniperScope
      ├─ Widget ................ → W_Scope_Sniper
      └─ Extension Point ....... → the HUD slot tag the scope mounts into

WID_Rifle_Sniper (Equipment Definition from the weapon recipe)
 └─ Ability Set To Grant — replace default ADS with GA_ADS_Sniper
```

The parent `GA_ADS` already pushes the camera mode and shows the widget on activate, and reverses both on end. Your subclass exists only to hold the per-weapon property values.

<!-- gb-stepper:start -->
<!-- gb-step:start -->
### Subclass `GA_ADS`

Create a new Gameplay Ability blueprint (or C++ class). **Subclass `GA_ADS`** at `Plugins/GameFeatures/ShooterBase/Content/Input/Abilities/GA_ADS`. Name it `GA_ADS_Sniper` and place it in your Game Feature Plugin's content folder.

Subclassing `GA_ADS` gives you all the ADS plumbing for free, input handling, blocking-tag setup, replication policy, end-on-input-release, _and_ the camera-mode push and widget-mount behaviour. You don't override anything; your subclass exists only to hold the sniper-specific property values you'll set in Step 4.

<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
### Custom camera mode for the scope view

The third-person sniper scope is mostly an illusion: the camera stays roughly where third-person normally puts it, the FOV drops dramatically (the zoom), and the visible "scope", the round black housing, crosshair, mil-dots, windage indicator, is the UI widget you'll build in Step 3. The camera mode handles the zoom; the widget handles everything that looks like a scope.

Create a new camera mode asset (subclass `CM_ThirdPersonADS`). Name it `CM_SniperScope`. Configure on the Class Defaults:

* **Field of View** — dramatically reduced (8× scope ≈ 8°, 12× scope ≈ 5°). Lower values give tighter zoom.
* **Blend Time** — short (0.1–0.2s) so raising the scope feels snappy.
* **Blend Function** — `EaseOut` or `EaseInOut` for a smooth settle.
* **Target Offset curves** — optional. The third-person base lets you nudge the offset relative to the character based on view pitch. Most snipers don't need this; the FOV change carries the effect.

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (290).png" alt="" title="CM_ThirdPersonADS">

Reference: [Camera Modes](../../base-lyra-modified/camera/camera-modes.md).

> [!INFO]
> **First-person scope.** A first-person sniper takes a different path entirely, instead of a UI scope, you align the weapon's scope mesh to the centre of the screen so the player looks _through_ the actual scope. That's a weapon-mesh manipulation, not a camera-mode change, and isn't covered by this recipe.
<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
### Scope widget (UMG)

Create a UMG widget, `W_Scope_Sniper`, that draws the scope reticle full-screen. Black borders top/bottom/sides for the scope-housing effect; crosshair / mil-dots in the centre.&#x20;

If you want the on-screen ammo counter to remain visible while scoped, layer it inside this widget; if not, leave it out and the player only sees the scope while ADS is active.
<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
### Configure `GA_ADS_Sniper`'s Class Defaults

Open `GA_ADS_Sniper` and look at its Class Defaults panel. The parent `GA_ADS` exposes the relevant ADS settings as properties, you don't override `Activate` or `EndAbility`; the parent already pushes the camera mode and mounts the widget on activate, and reverses both on end, driven by these values:

* **Camera Mode** → `CM_SniperScope` (from Step 2). The parent pushes this on activate, pops on end.
* **Widget** → `W_Scope_Sniper` (from Step 3). The parent mounts this while the ability is active and removes it when the ability ends.
* **Extension Point** → the gameplay tag for the HUD slot where the scope should mount. Match this to a slot your HUD declares for full-screen ADS overlays.

Save and compile. That's the customization.
<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
### Wire `GA_ADS_Sniper` into the sniper's Ability Set

Open the Ability Set used by `WID_Rifle_Sniper` (the equipment definition for the sniper variant from the [weapon recipe](custom-weapon.md), or your own custom weapon equipment definition). Replace the default `GA_ADS` entry with `GA_ADS_Sniper`. Save.

Now whenever the player has the sniper equipped, holding the ADS input runs the sniper-specific ability. Other weapons keep using the generic ADS, that separation is _why_ the abilities are granted through the equipment definition rather than baked into the Pawn Data.

References: [Defining Equippable Items](../../base-lyra-modified/equipment/defining-equippable-items.md), [Ability Sets](../../base-lyra-modified/gas/ability-sets.md).
<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
### Verify

1. Equip the sniper variant in PIE.
2. Hold ADS input → camera mode blends to the scope view, scope widget appears, sway is dampened.
3. Release ADS input → camera blends back, scope widget hides, normal HUD restored.
4. Take a long-range shot while scoped, confirm the bullet drop you tuned in the [weapon recipe](custom-weapon.md) is visible at range.

If the camera mode doesn't push, check the Camera Mode property in Step 4, the reference may be unset. If the widget doesn't mount, check the Widget reference and the Extension Point tag in Step 4: the tag must exactly match a slot your HUD declares.
<!-- gb-step:end -->
<!-- gb-stepper:end -->

## Worked Example #2 — Stim Injection (from-scratch)

For Sniper ADS the parent did all the work. **Stim Injection is the opposite case**, no existing parent fits "press a button to apply a temporary self-buff," so you author the ability from scratch. Subclass `ULyraGameplayAbility` directly, write the `Activate` graph, apply effects, wire a custom input, and call `EndAbility` when the buff duration ends.

The behaviour: press an input → a 5-second heal-over-time begins on the player → cooldown applies → the ability ends when the buff duration expires. Modeled after COD-style stim shots.

Six steps. Scaffold the ability and supporting assets first; write the activation logic last.

<!-- gb-stepper:start -->
<!-- gb-step:start -->
#### Subclass `ULyraGameplayAbility`

Create a new Gameplay Ability blueprint. **Subclass `ULyraGameplayAbility`**, the framework's base class for abilities with no specialised parent. Name it `GA_StimInjection` and place it in your Game Feature Plugin's content folder.

Configure on Class Defaults:

* **Replication Policy** — `Do Not Replicate`, the ability does not to replicate. The ability will run once on the client and then on the server separately.
* **Net Execution Policy** — `Local Predicted`  for input-responsive self-buffs like this. The buff effect should feel instant on the local client
* **Ability Tags** — a unique tag identifying this ability (e.g. `Ability.StimInjection`).
* **Activation Owned Tags** — tags applied to the player while the ability is active (e.g. `Status.Buff.StimActive`). Useful if other systems (animation, audio, FX) need to know the player is in the stim state. The framework adds and removes these automatically.
* **Cancel / Block Abilities With Tag** — usually leave empty for a self-buff.

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (314).png" alt="" title="">
<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
#### Cooldown Gameplay Effect

Create a new Gameplay Effect (e.g. `GE_Cooldown_StimInjection`). Configure:

* **Duration Policy** — `Has Duration`, with the cooldown length (e.g. 30 seconds).
* **Granted Tags** — add a tag like `Cooldown.Ability.StimInjection`. The `Cooldown.*` namespace is convention, not requirement.

The ability checks for this tag's absence before activating and applies the GE on activation; the framework removes the tag automatically when the duration expires.

Reference: [Gameplay Effects](../../base-lyra-modified/gas/gameplay-effects.md).
<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
#### Buff Gameplay Effect

Create the buff effect (e.g. `GE_Heal_Stim`). The primary effect is a heal-over-time on the player's health. Configure:

* **Duration Policy** — `Has Duration`, with the buff length (e.g. 5 seconds).
* **Period** — how often the heal ticks (e.g. 1 second).
* **Modifiers** — apply a healing modifier to the Health attribute on `LyraHealthSet`. Each period, the modifier fires and the player's health goes up by the configured amount. Five seconds at +20 per second restores 100 health total over the duration; tune to taste.

When the duration expires the framework removes the GE automatically, the heal ticks stop and any granted tags clear, with no manual cleanup.

Reference: [Damage and Healing](../../base-lyra-modified/gas/damage-and-healing.md).
<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
#### Custom input wiring

Stim Injection needs a new input, the default IMC doesn't ship a stim key. Four small assets, all standard Lyra input plumbing:

* **Input Action** (e.g. `IA_StimInjection`) — defines the input as a digital button press.
* **Input Mapping Context** — add `IA_StimInjection` to your project's existing default IMC, or create a new IMC for your equipment / mode.
* **Input Config** — bind the Input Action to an input tag (e.g. `IA_StimInjection` → `InputTag.Ability.StimInjection`).
* The pairing of `InputTag.Ability.StimInjection` to `GA_StimInjection` happens in the Ability Set in Step 6.

Reference: [Input](../../base-lyra-modified/input/).
<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
#### Author the `ActivateAbility` graph

This is the meaty step. In `GA_StimInjection`'s `ActivateAbility` graph:

1. **`CommitAbility`** first. This runs cost / cooldown checks and applies the cooldown GE from Step 2. **If you skip this, the cooldown never applies and the ability can be spammed.**
2. **`ApplyGameplayEffectToOwner`** with `GE_Buff_Stim` from Step 3. The heal-over-time begins ticking on the player.
3. From **`ApplyGameplayEffectToOwner`** → **`EndAbility`**. **This is the moment the ability ends.** Without it, the ability stays active forever, `Status.Buff.StimActive` stays on the player, the buff GE expires normally but the ability instance never gets cleaned up, and reactivation is silently blocked.

The `Status.Buff.StimActive` tag from Activation Owned Tags in Step 1 is automatically applied when `Activate` runs and removed when `EndAbility` is called, no manual tag management needed.

<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (315).png" alt="" title="">
<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
#### Wire `GA_StimInjection` into the Ability Set

Open the Ability Set the player should receive Stim Injection through. Add a new entry:

* **Ability** → `GA_StimInjection`
* **Input tag** → `InputTag.Ability.StimInjection` (the tag from Step 4)

Where the Ability Set lives depends on whether the ability is character-level or equipment-granted:

* **Character-level** (every player has the stim from spawn), add to the default Ability Set on the Pawn Data your Experience uses.
* **Equipment-level** (only players equipped with a stim-injector item or specific class can use it), create an Ability Set, reference it from an Equipment Definition, give the equipment to players via the Equipment Manager Component's `StartingEquipment` or via a `WorldCollectableSpawner`.
<!-- gb-step:end -->

<!-- gb-step:start -->
#### Verify

1. Launch your Experience in PIE.
2. Press the stim input. Confirm:
   * `Status.Buff.StimActive` is on the player (use `showdebug abilitysystem`).
3. Press the input again immediately, it should be blocked by `Cooldown.Ability.StimInjection` still being present.
4. Wait for the 30-second cooldown to expire, press again, it should activate cleanly.
<!-- gb-step:end -->
<!-- gb-stepper:end -->

***

## Common pitfalls

These are the four ways abilities break that you'll see most often. Three of the four work in a single-player PIE session and only manifest in multiplayer, a particularly cruel failure mode.

* **Forgetting to call `EndAbility`.** Abilities don't auto-end. If your custom Activate path forgets to end the ability, the ability stays active forever, blocking tags stay applied, ability cooldowns never start, and the player can't reactivate it.
* **Wrong trigger tag / input tag.** The ability has a tag that the input system uses to find it. If the tag on the ability and the tag in the input mapping don't match _exactly_, the ability is granted but never activates, and there's no error. If your ability isn't firing, this is the first thing to check.
* **Wrong blocking / cancellation tags.** Abilities cancel each other through tag relationships. A misconfigured blocking tag means your ability cancels something it shouldn't (the player can't fire while crouched), or _is_ cancelled by something it shouldn't be (your ADS ends the moment another ability starts). Set blocking tags only for genuine conflicts.
* **Wrong replication policy.** `Local Predicted` for client-responsiveness, `Server Initiated` for server-authority, `Server Only` for server-only logic. Pick the wrong one and the ability works in PIE-as-listen-server but fails in dedicated-server or PIE-as-client.

***

## Debug helpers

When an ability misbehaves, two console commands get you 80% of the way:

* **`showdebug abilitysystem`** — overlays the player's granted abilities, currently active abilities, applied gameplay effects, and current gameplay tags. If your ability isn't in the granted list, it wasn't granted; if it's granted but never appears in the active list, it's failing to activate (blocking tags, replication, or trigger).
* **`showdebug enhancedinput`** — overlays the active input mappings and which abilities each input is wired to. Use this to confirm your ability tag is reachable from the input you're pressing, and that no higher-priority mapping is shadowing it.

Run both at once in PIE. Together they answer: _is the ability granted, is the input reaching it, is something cancelling it?_

***

## More ability ideas

If you want to author another ability after these two, here are short sketches for a few that don't ship with the framework. Like Active Scan, these are genuinely new behaviours, so they go in standalone abilities subclassing `ULyraGameplayAbility` directly. (Copying an existing ability as a starting template is a fine shortcut where one is close enough.)

* **Self-Revive.** For BR / extraction modes. Player goes "down", holds an input for N seconds, recovers. Touches: down-state tag check, channelled-cast pattern (cancellable on damage / movement), cooldown GE, animation montage, optional UI revive bar.
* **Ground Slam.** Less typical for a shooter, but useful as a movement ultimate. Leap up, slam down, AoE damage on impact. Touches: movement override during the leap, AoE damage GE, on-impact cue, cooldown GE.

For all three, [Abilities](../../base-lyra-modified/gas/abilities.md) is the reference, and [Gameplay Effects](../../base-lyra-modified/gas/gameplay-effects.md) covers cooldown / damage GE patterns.

***

## How to extend further

* **Granting through Pawn Data instead of Equipment.** For abilities that should belong to the _character_ (sprint, slide, the scan pulse above), grant them through the Pawn Data's default Ability Set rather than per-weapon. See [Pawn Data](../../base-lyra-modified/gameframework-and-experience/lyrapawndata.md).
* **Triggering on gameplay events.** Abilities can activate from events (kill, hit, damage taken) instead of inputs. Useful for accolade abilities, reactive cues, automatic state changes.
* **Cooldowns and costs.** [Gameplay Effects](../../base-lyra-modified/gas/gameplay-effects.md) is also where you author cooldown and resource-cost effects that the ability checks before activating.
* **Custom ability-system attributes.** If your ability needs to read or modify a stat that doesn't exist yet (charge level, ability charges), see [Attribute Sets](../../base-lyra-modified/gas/attribute-sets.md).

When you're ready for a different system, head back to the [Recipes](./).
