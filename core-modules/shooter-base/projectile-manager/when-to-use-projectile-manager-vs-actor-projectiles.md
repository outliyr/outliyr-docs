# When to use Projectile Manager vs Actor Projectiles

ShooterBase offers two distinct systems for handling projectiles, each suited for different scenarios:

1. **The Projectile Manager:** A high-performance, multithreaded system simulating projectiles as data structures (`FTraceProjectile`) with lag-compensated, trace-based collision.
2. [**Actor-Based Projectiles**](../weapons/projectile-system/)**:** Using standard `AActor` subclasses (typically inheriting from `AProjectileBase`) spawned directly into the world, often utilizing `UProjectileMovementComponent` for physics and potentially `UGameplayAbility_PredictiveProjectile` for client-side prediction.

Choosing the right system depends heavily on the specific requirements of the weapon and the desired gameplay characteristics.

> * `GA_Weapon_Fire_BulletDrop`: Inherits from [`UGameplayAbility_RangedWeapon_Projectile`](../weapons/shooting-gameplay-abilities/base-projectile-ability/). This ability requests projectile spawns via the **Projectile Manager** system (by sending an `FNewTraceProjectileMessage`). It's intended as a base for weapons firing standard, fast-moving bullets where performance and lag compensation are key. Weapons typically subclass this Blueprint ability to customize parameters like HitEffect, ImpactCueNotify, penetration rules, etc.
> * `GA_Weapon_Fire_Projectile`: Inherits from [`UGameplayAbility_PredictiveProjectile`](../weapons/shooting-gameplay-abilities/predictive-projectile-ability/). This ability directly spawns [**Actor-Based Projectiles**](../weapons/projectile-system/) (`AProjectileBase` subclasses) with client-side prediction. It serves as a base for weapons launching special projectiles like grenades or rockets where actor-specific logic or high-fidelity prediction is required. Weapons subclass this Blueprint ability to define the specific AProjectileBase class to spawn and customize other parameters.

### Use the Projectile Manager When:

* **High Volume / High Fire Rate is Expected:** This is the primary reason for the Manager's existence. If a weapon fires very rapidly (e.g., automatic rifles, SMGs, miniguns) or if you anticipate many players firing simultaneously, the performance overhead of spawning hundreds or thousands of individual projectile actors can become prohibitive. The Manager's data-oriented, threaded approach scales much better.
* **Performance is Critical:** If maintaining high server frame rates under heavy load is paramount, offloading projectile simulation and collision to a separate thread significantly reduces the burden on the main game thread.
* **Accurate Lag-Compensated Hits are Essential for Fast "Bullets":** The Manager's tight integration with the Lag Compensation system ensures that collisions for these fast-moving traces are validated against historical character positions, providing fair and accurate hit registration crucial for typical bullet weapons.
* **Simpler Physics Suffice:** The Manager currently implements gravity and basic penetration. If your projectile only needs these, the Manager is efficient.
* **Standard Bullet Behavior is Desired:** If the projectile primarily needs to travel in a predictable path (straight or parabolic) and register hits or penetrate thin surfaces, the Manager provides this efficiently.

**In short: Use the Projectile Manager for typical "bullet" weapons found in most modern shooters where performance and accurate hit registration at high volumes are key.**

### Use Actor-Based Projectiles (`AProjectileBase`) When:

* **Complex or Unique Behaviors are Needed:** [Actor-based projectiles](../weapons/projectile-system/) are far more flexible for implementing custom logic. Use them if your projectile needs to:
  * Perform complex homing or seeking behavior.
  * Have timed detonation or proximity triggers.
  * Split into multiple projectiles mid-flight.
  * Interact with the world in ways beyond simple collision (e.g., attaching to surfaces, applying persistent area effects).
  * Utilize complex physics interactions beyond basic gravity and bouncing (though `UProjectileMovementComponent` offers significant features).
* **Slower Projectiles:** For grenades, rockets, arrows, fireballs, etc., where the travel time is significant and the number of active projectiles at any given time is relatively low, the performance overhead of actors is usually acceptable.
* **Detailed Visual Prediction is Paramount:** The [`UGameplayAbility_PredictiveProjectile`](../weapons/shooting-gameplay-abilities/predictive-projectile-ability/) ability, working with `AProjectileBase`, provides sophisticated client-side prediction including the visual actor itself, which is crucial for making slower projectiles feel responsive and visually synchronized for the firing player. The Projectile Manager only provides hit validation, not full predictive actor spawning/synchronization.
* **Easier Blueprint Implementation:** Implementing complex behaviors is often more straightforward using Blueprint logic within an `AActor` subclass compared to modifying the C++ simulation thread of the Projectile Manager.
* **Leveraging Existing Actor/Component Features:** You can easily add other standard components (Particle Systems, Audio Components, other logic components) directly to an actor-based projectile.

**In short: Use Actor-based projectiles for slower, less numerous projectiles that require unique gameplay logic, complex physics interactions, or detailed client-side visual prediction.**

> **In essence, think of Actor-Based Projectiles for grenades, rockets, specialized ammunition, magic spells, or anything that doesn't behave like a standard bullet.**

### Can They Coexist?

Yes, absolutely. A typical project using the ShooterBase plugin will likely use **both** systems:

* Assault rifles, SMGs, pistols might use the **Projectile Manager** (spawned via `GA_Weapon_Fire_BulletDrop`).&#x20;
* Rocket launchers, grenade launchers, bows might use **Actor-Based Projectiles** (spawned via `GA_Weapon_Fire_Projectile`).&#x20;

The choice is made at the Gameplay Ability level â€“ the ability determines whether to send a message to the `UProjectileManager` or to spawn an `AProjectileBase` actor. Different weapons granted by the `ULyraEquipmentDefinition` can simply grant different firing abilities.

***

### Can You Mix Them?

Yes, absolutely. A single weapon could potentially have:

* A primary fire mode using the **Projectile Manager** (via a message-sending ability like `GA_Weapon_Fire_BulletDrop`) for its standard bullets.
* An alternate fire mode using an **Actor-Based Projectile** ability (like `GA_Weapon_Fire_Projectile`) to launch a grenade (`AGrenadeProjectile` subclass of `AProjectileBase`).

***

### Extending the Projectile Manager (Caution Advised)

While the Actor-based system is easily extended by subclassing `AProjectileBase` and `UGameplayAbility_PredictiveProjectile`, extending the **Projectile Manager** to support fundamentally different projectile behaviors (e.g., adding complex homing logic to the simulation thread) is **significantly more difficult**.

* It requires modifying the C++ code of `FProjectileThreadRunnable`.
* You need strong expertise in multithreading, thread safety, physics simulation, and the existing architecture.
* Adding complex logic can negatively impact the performance benefits the system was designed to provide.

**Recommendation:** If your projectile requires custom logic or a travel path not supported by the parameters in `FNewTraceProjectileMessage` and simple gravity simulation, **strongly prefer using the Actor-Based Projectile system** (`AProjectileBase`). Only consider extending the Projectile Manager's thread logic if you have a very specific, performance-critical need for simulating large numbers of projectiles with that new behavior and possess the required expertise.

By choosing the appropriate system based on the projectile's intended behavior and performance requirements, you can leverage the strengths of both approaches provided by ShooterBase.
