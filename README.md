# Welcome

This documentation will guide you through using the **Outliyr Framework** for **Unreal Engine 5**. Whether you're an indie developer, a team building a competitive shooter, or someone looking to extend Lyra with production-ready systems, this framework is designed to help you build faster and scale smarter.

***

### What Is This Framework?

The Outliyr Framework is a **modular multiplayer shooter foundation** built on top of Epic Games’ Lyra Starter Game. It expands Lyra’s systems to provide a complete, extensible shooter base that supports both first-person and third-person perspectives.

This framework includes:

* True first-person camera and animation support
* Advanced inventory systems (grid or Tetris-style)
* Modular weapon and attachment architecture
* Lag compensation, kill cam, immersive spectating
* Prebuilt game modes: Team Deathmatch, Search & Destroy, Extraction, Battle Royale, and more

***

### Why Build on Lyra?

Lyra is Unreal Engine's reference shooter project built by Epic Games using best practices for modular multiplayer development. It includes:

* A robust Gameplay Ability System (GAS)
* Modular Gameplay through Game Feature Plugins and the Experience System
* AAA-level architecture seen in games like Fortnite

However, Lyra is a tech demo—not a full game framework. Outliyr builds on Lyra’s foundation and adds:

* A structured project layout ready for real development
* Fully integrated and extendable game systems
* Modern shooter features commonly required in production

***

### Who Is This Framework For?

* Indie developers building competitive multiplayer shooters
* Small teams or studios who want a solid Unreal-based shooter foundation
* Developers looking to skip reinventing common systems like loadouts, UI, and weapon logic
* Newcomers to Lyra who need a more practical, usable starting point

### Key Benefits

* **Save time** — Focus on building your game, not rewriting boilerplate systems
* **Production-ready** — Fully integrated multiplayer shooter mechanics
* **Modular and extensible** — Add or remove features as needed using Game Feature Plugins
* **Optimized for multiplayer** — Built with replication and performance in mind
* **Accessible architecture** — A hybrid C++/Blueprint design suitable for both programmers and designers
